Output 0,"Based on the provided document, some examples of AI mentioned are:

1. Word embedding: representing words as vectors encoding their meaning.
2. Transformers: a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism.
3. Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models: capable of generating coherent text.
4. Word-sense disambiguation: a technique used to resolve the meaning of words in a specific context.
5. Micro-worlds: a domain-restricted approach to natural language processing.

These examples are mentioned in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI)."
