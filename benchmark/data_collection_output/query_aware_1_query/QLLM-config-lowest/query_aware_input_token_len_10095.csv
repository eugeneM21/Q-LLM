Output 0,"Based on the provided document, some examples of AI mentioned are:

1. A system that classifies images with a ruler as ""cancerous"" because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.
2. A machine learning system that classifies patients with asthma as being at ""low risk"" of dying from pneumonia, despite asthma being a severe risk factor.
