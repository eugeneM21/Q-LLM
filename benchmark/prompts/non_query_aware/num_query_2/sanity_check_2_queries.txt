Below is a long document containing multiple paragraphs about different topics including biology, history, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. At the end of the document, a question will be asked, and your task is to answer it based only on the relevant parts of the document.

[Biology]
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product. Plants also undergo respiration, where they break down sugar molecules to release energy.

[History]
The Roman Empire, at its peak, encompassed most of Europe, parts of the Middle East, and North Africa. Julius Caesar played a significant role in its transition from Republic to Empire. The empire eventually declined due to internal conflict, economic troubles, and invasions by barbarian tribes.

[Space Exploration]
The first successful landing on the Moon occurred in 1969 with NASA's Apollo 11 mission. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first humans to walk on the lunar surface. Since then, numerous missions have explored Mars, the outer planets, and distant galaxies using telescopes and space probes like Voyager and James Webb.

[Artificial Intelligence]
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI systems are capable of learning from data, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are key areas of modern AI. GPT-based language models are powerful examples of generative AI systems.

[Philosophy]
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are foundational figures in Western philosophy. Socratic questioning promotes critical thinking. Plato's theory of forms and Aristotle's logic have influenced thought for centuries. Eastern philosophy also offers rich traditions, such as Confucian ethics and Buddhist teachings on impermanence and mindfulness.

Below is a long document containing multiple paragraphs about Artificial Intelligence. Your task is to answer the question based only on the relevant parts of the document.

--- Start of Document ---
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.

High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."
